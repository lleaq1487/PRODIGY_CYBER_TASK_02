# PRODIGY_CYBER_TASK_02

Overview :

The Pixel Encryption of Image project aims to explore image encryption techniques at the pixel level, focusing on enhancing the security of digital images. This project utilizes cryptographic algorithms to modify pixel values, making the image unreadable without the appropriate decryption key. By implementing pixel-level encryption, we can protect sensitive image data and explore the potential of encryption in visual security.

Objective :

The primary goal of this project is to:

Encrypt digital images at the pixel level using cryptographic methods.

Ensure that the encrypted image can only be viewed in its original form with the correct decryption key.

Understand and implement encryption techniques for digital images to protect sensitive visual data.

Key Features :

Pixel-level Encryption: Modify the pixel values of an image using encryption algorithms such as AES or XOR.

Image Decryption: Implement a decryption process that restores the original image using the appropriate key.

Security Enhancement: Provide an additional layer of security to digital images, making it difficult for unauthorized users to access the original content.

Visualization: Display both encrypted and decrypted images for visual verification.

Technologies Used :

Python: Programming language used for implementing the encryption and decryption algorithms.

OpenCV: Library for image processing and visualization of images.

NumPy: Used for handling pixel data and performing matrix operations on images.

Cryptography Libraries: Cryptographic algorithms for pixel encryption, including AES or XOR-based encryption.
